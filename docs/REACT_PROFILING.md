# React DevTools Profiling Guide for AlgoTouch

## Overview
This guide provides instructions for using React DevTools Profiler to identify and fix performance issues in the AlgoTouch application.

## Getting Started with React DevTools

### Installation
1. For Chrome: Install [React Developer Tools](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/react-developer-tools/fmkadmapgofadopljbjfkapdkoienihi)
2. For Firefox: Install [React Developer Tools](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/react-devtools/)

### Basic Profiling Process
1. Open AlgoTouch in development mode
2. Open browser DevTools (F12 or right-click → Inspect)
3. Navigate to the "Profiler" tab in React DevTools
4. Click the record button (⚫)
5. Perform the interactions you want to analyze
6. Stop recording
7. Analyze the flame chart and ranked chart

## Critical Components to Profile

The following components are particularly important to profile due to their complexity or frequency of updates:

### Dashboard Components
- StockIndicesSection (real-time data)
- BlogSection (content loading)
- Courses display

### Trade Journal
- ModernTraderQuestionnaire (complex form)
- QuestionnaireResults (heavy visualization)

### Trade Analysis
- TradeCharts components
- Performance visualization components

### Subscription Flow
- PaymentSection (critical user flow)
- ContractSection (document handling)

## Common Performance Issues to Look For

### 1. Unnecessary Re-renders
- Components re-rendering when props haven't changed
- Parent component re-renders causing all children to re-render

**Solution:** Use `React.memo()`, implement proper dependency arrays in hooks

### 2. Expensive Calculations
- Heavy data processing during render
- Complex calculations being recomputed unnecessarily

**Solution:** Move to `useMemo()` or compute outside render

### 3. Inefficient Prop Passing
- Passing new object/function references on every render
- Prop drilling through many components

**Solution:** Use `useCallback()` for functions, restructure component hierarchy

### 4. Unoptimized Context Usage
- Components re-rendering due to context changes they don't use
- Large context providers causing widespread re-renders

**Solution:** Split contexts, use `useMemo` for context values

## Optimization Patterns

### Component Memoization

```jsx
// Before
const ExpensiveComponent = (props) => {
  // Component logic
};

// After
const ExpensiveComponent = React.memo((props) => {
  // Component logic
});
```

### Callback Memoization

```jsx
// Before
const ParentComponent = () => {
  const handleClick = () => {
    // Handler logic
  };
  return <ChildComponent onClick={handleClick} />;
};

// After
const ParentComponent = () => {
  const handleClick = useCallback(() => {
    // Handler logic
  }, [/* dependencies */]);
  return <ChildComponent onClick={handleClick} />;
};
```

### Value Memoization

```jsx
// Before
const Component = () => {
  const processedData = heavyProcessing(data);
  return <div>{processedData}</div>;
};

// After
const Component = () => {
  const processedData = useMemo(() => 
    heavyProcessing(data), 
    [data]
  );
  return <div>{processedData}</div>;
};
```

## Profiling Checklist

When profiling a component, ask these questions:
- Does it render more often than necessary?
- Are there expensive operations in the render path?
- Is it processing large amounts of data on each render?
- Does it have many children that re-render unnecessarily?
- Is it causing layout shifts or browser reflow?

## Reporting Performance Issues

When you identify a performance issue:
1. Document the component and scenario
2. Take a screenshot or recording of the profiling results
3. Estimate the impact (minor, moderate, severe)
4. Suggest potential optimizations
5. Create a ticket in the project management system
