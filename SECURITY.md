## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a security vulnerability within AlgoTouch, please send an email to [security@algotouch.com](mailto:security@algotouch.com). All security vulnerabilities will be promptly addressed.

## Dependency Management

This project uses GitHub's Dependabot to automatically scan for vulnerable dependencies. Dependabot creates pull requests to update dependencies when security vulnerabilities are found.

### How We Handle Dependencies

1. **Automated Scanning**: Dependabot scans dependencies daily and creates PRs for security updates.
2. **Manual Review**: All PRs created by Dependabot require manual review before merging.
3. **Testing**: Before merging any dependency updates, we test functionality to ensure no breaking changes.
4. **Manual Auditing**: We periodically run `npm audit` to identify and fix any vulnerabilities.

### Guidelines for Reviewing Dependabot PRs

When reviewing a Dependabot pull request:

1. Check the changelog or release notes for the updated package.
2. Run the application locally to verify that no functionality is broken.
3. Run tests to ensure all tests pass with the updated dependency.
4. If there are breaking changes, assess the effort required to adapt our code.

## Manual Security Audits

To manually check for vulnerabilities:

```bash
# Check for vulnerabilities
npm audit

# Fix vulnerabilities (where possible automatically)
npm audit fix

# For vulnerability fixes that require major version changes
npm audit fix --force # Use with caution
```

## Automated Security Tools

AlgoTouch employs several automated security tools in its CI/CD pipeline to ensure code quality and security:

### CodeQL Analysis

We use GitHub's CodeQL for advanced semantic code analysis to detect security vulnerabilities:

- Runs on every push to the main branch and on all pull requests
- Analyzes JavaScript and TypeScript code
- Detects common vulnerabilities such as SQL injection, XSS, and more
- Reports are available in the GitHub Security tab

### Static Application Security Testing (SAST)

We use SonarCloud for static code analysis:

- Runs on every push to the main branch and on all pull requests
- Identifies code smells, bugs, and security vulnerabilities
- Enforces code quality gates that can block merges if critical issues are found
- Reports are available in the SonarCloud dashboard

### Dynamic Application Security Testing (DAST)

We use OWASP ZAP for dynamic security testing of our deployed application:

- Runs automatically after successful deployments to the staging environment
- Performs automated penetration testing on the live application
- Scans for vulnerabilities like XSS, CSRF, and injection attacks
- Reports are uploaded as artifacts in the workflow runs

### Security Severity Levels

We categorize security issues according to the following severity levels:

1. **Critical**: Must be fixed immediately. Blocks releases.
2. **High**: Should be fixed as soon as possible, preferably before the next release.
3. **Medium**: Should be planned for remediation in upcoming sprints.
4. **Low**: Should be addressed when time permits.

### Response Procedures

When security issues are identified by our automated tools:

1. Critical and high severity issues trigger notifications to the security team.
2. Critical issues automatically fail the CI pipeline to prevent deployment.
3. All security findings are reviewed during sprint planning for prioritization.
4. Fixed vulnerabilities are verified by re-running the security tools.
