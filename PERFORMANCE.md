# AlgoTouch Performance Guide

## Overview
This document outlines the performance monitoring approach for AlgoTouch, including key metrics, tools, and optimization strategies.

## Key Performance Metrics

### Core Web Vitals
| Metric | Target | Description |
|--------|--------|-------------|
| **Largest Contentful Paint (LCP)** | < 2.5s | Time until the largest content element is visible |
| **First Input Delay (FID)** | < 100ms | Time from user interaction to browser response |
| **Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS)** | < 0.1 | Measure of visual stability |
| **First Contentful Paint (FCP)** | < 1.8s | Time until first content is painted |
| **Time to Interactive (TTI)** | < 3.8s | Time until page is fully interactive |

### AlgoTouch-Specific KPIs
- Dashboard data load time: < 200ms
- Trade chart rendering time: < 500ms
- Form submission response time: < 300ms

## Monitoring Tools

### 1. Lighthouse CI
We use Lighthouse CI to automatically measure performance on key pages:
- Homepage
- Dashboard
- Trade Journal
- Subscription page
- Courses page

Results are stored as GitHub Actions artifacts and can be viewed in the Actions tab.

### 2. React DevTools Profiler
React DevTools Profiler is used to identify:
- Unnecessary re-renders
- Slow component rendering
- Inefficient prop passing

### 3. Load Testing with k6
k6 is used for API and user flow load testing, focusing on:
- API response times under load
- Backend performance with concurrent users
- Resource utilization during peak usage

## Optimization Techniques

### Component Optimization
- Use `React.memo()` for pure functional components
- Apply `useMemo()` for expensive calculations
- Use `useCallback()` for function references passed as props
- Implement virtualization for long lists via `react-window` or similar

### Code Splitting Guidelines
- Use dynamic imports for routes (`React.lazy()`)
- Split code by feature, not by file type
- Consider component-level code splitting for heavy components

### Rendering Optimization
- Minimize state updates that trigger re-renders
- Use proper keys in lists to optimize diffing
- Avoid inline function creation in render methods
- Debounce or throttle frequent events

## Performance Testing Process

### Pre-Deployment Testing
1. Run Lighthouse locally on development build
2. Profile critical user journeys with React DevTools
3. Test with throttled CPU/network to simulate low-end devices

### Continuous Monitoring
1. Lighthouse CI runs on every push to main and weekly
2. Load tests run on a scheduled basis
3. Monitor real user metrics with analytics
